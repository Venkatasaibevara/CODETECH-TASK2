Overview of the project:-

 1. Designing the FSM

State Diagram:
- Define States: Identify all the states the FSM will have.
- State Transitions: Determine the conditions under which the FSM will transition from one state to another.
- Outputs: Define the outputs for each state or transition.

2. Writing Verilog or VHDL Code

- Module Definition: Define the FSM as a module, specifying inputs (like clock, reset, and input signals) and outputs.
- State Encoding: Assign binary codes to represent each state.
- State Transition Logic: Implement the logic to handle state transitions based on inputs and current states.
- Output Logic: Define the output logic, which could be dependent on the current state or state transitions.

3.Creating Testbenches

- Testbench Setup: Write a testbench to instantiate the FSM module.
- Apply Stimuli: Apply various input sequences to the FSM to test different states and transitions.
- Monitor Outputs: Observe the outputs and state transitions to ensure they match the expected behavior.

 4. Simulating the FSM

- Compile and Simulate: Use the VLSI software's simulation tools to compile the FSM design and testbench.
- Analyze Waveforms: Use the waveform viewer to analyze the state transitions and outputs over time.
- Check Correctness: Verify that the FSM transitions correctly between states and produces the expected outputs.

 5. Debugging and Verification**

- Troubleshooting: If the FSM does not behave as expected, debug the design by checking the state transition and output logic.
- Iterative Simulation: Make necessary corrections and re-simulate the FSM to verify the changes.

6. Final Validation

- Functional Verification: Ensure the FSM meets the design specifications and correctly implements the desired behavior.
- Documentation: Document the state diagram, design, simulation results, and any observations.
